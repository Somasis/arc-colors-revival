This is a set of backgrounds (and their sources) created to fit with the
GNOME Colors icon theme and Zukitwo Colors GTK theme.

The [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file is untouched, as well as most files here. The
only changes I have made are moving the GDM themes to the [old folder](/old/arc-colors)
since GDM 3 is not compatible with them; only GDM 2 or MDM (probably) is compatible
with all the themes here.

The backgrounds, of course, work just fine.
